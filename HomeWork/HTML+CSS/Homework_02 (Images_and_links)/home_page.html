        Create 3 different HTML documents (home, about, contact) and link them together using hyperlinks!<br>
        Put different content in the body of every HTML document including 4 images that will link to external websites.<br>
        Create a "back to the top of the page" link on the bottom that will link to the top of the home page!<br>

        <h2>Hyperlink</h2>
        <p>
        In computing, a <strong>hyperlink</strong>, or simply a link, is a reference to <br>
        data that the reader can directly follow either by clicking, tapping, or hovering.<br>
        A hyperlink points to a whole document or to a specific element within a document.<br>
        Hypertext is text with hyperlinks. The text that is linked from is called anchor text. <br>
        A software system that is used for viewing and creating hypertext is a hypertext system, <br>
        and to create a hyperlink is to hyperlink (or simply to link).<br>
         A user following hyperlinks is said to navigate or browse the hypertext.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
        The document containing a <strong>hyperlink</strong> is known as its source document. <br>
        For example, in an online reference work such as Wikipedia, or Google, <br>
        many words and terms in the text are hyperlinked to definitions of those terms. <br>
        Hyperlinks are often used to implement reference mechanisms such as <br>
        tables of contents, footnotes, bibliographies, indexes, letters and glossaries<br>
        </p>

        <p>
        The effect of following a <strong>hyperlink</strong> may vary with the hypertext system and <br>
        may sometimes depend on the link itself; for instance, on the World Wide Web most<br>
        hyperlinks cause the target document to replace the document being displayed,<br>
        but some are marked to cause the target document to open in a new window. <br>
        Another possibility is transclusion, for which the link target <br>
        is a document fragment that replaces the link anchor within the source document.<br>
        Not only persons browsing the document follow hyperlinks. <br>
        These hyperlinks may also be followed automatically by programs. <br>
        A program that traverses the hypertext, following each hyperlink and gathering all the<br>
        retrieved documents is known as a Web spider or crawler.<br>
        </p>

        <h3>Inline links</h3>
        <p>
        An inline link displays remote content without the need for embedding the content. <br>
        The remote content may be accessed with or without the user selecting the link.<br>
        An inline link may display a modified version of the content; for instance, instead of an image, <br>
        a thumbnail, low resolution preview, cropped section, or magnified section may be shown. <br>
        The full content is then usually available on demand, as is the case with print publishing software â€“ e.g.,<br>
        with an external link. This allows for smaller file sizes and quicker response <br>
        to changes when the full linked content is not needed, as is the case when rearranging a page layout.<br>
